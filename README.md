LAMP sampling

This is my SALT LAMPSTACK installation for Xubuntu linux  with apache2, mariadb & php7.2. The setup also creates index.html and index.php testpages for apache. index.php also test database connection with mariadb that creates an user & database automaticly. 
In this example SQL user and database are named as 'heppa' and it has a table called 'model'. The Xubuntu linux user id is 'xubuntu' for the home directory file associations.   

 + few other little installations such as Vlc with new skin interface and changing Xubuntu 18.04 terminal font bigger with Salt and 
 some other useful programs. 
 
 There is also start.sh that should install everything with as little fuzz as possible. Just download it with wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OtsoR/LAMP/master/start.sh .
