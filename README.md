LAMP sampling

This is my SALT LAMPSTACK installation for Xubuntu linux  with apache2, mariadb & php7.2. The setup also creates index.html and index.php testpages for apache. index.php also test database connection with mariadb that creates an user & database automaticly. 
In this example SQL user and database are name as 'heppa' and it has a table called 'model'. The Xubuntu linux user id is 'xubuntu' for the home directory file associations.
